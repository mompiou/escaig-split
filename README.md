# Escaig split

A script to compute the orientation factor in the Friedel-Escaig model of cross-slip in fcc crystals.

```escaig-split.py``` draws:

- the Schmid factor (SF) for the primary slip plane, i.e. prop. to the shear stress $\tau$:

- the difference in the SF of partial dislocations in the primary plane (prop. to $\tau'_d$)

-the diffrence in the SF of partial dislocations in the cross-slip plane (prop. to $\tau_d$)

-the orientation factor prop to $(2/3 \tau_d +\tau_d')/\tau$
